What is it?
-----------
The flight detective tool is intended to do an extensive study on flights on
different days, using different engines and extract the best prices. It's based
on a headless browser (PhantomJS) to generate results and then sort them
appropriately.

Latest version
--------------
The flight detective project is currently being hosted on Github, more
concretely in the address https://github.com/jmtorrespalma/flight-detective.git,
but the intention is to migrate it to a private server while maintaining this
one as a mirror.

Licensing
---------
See the file accompanying this project called COPYING.

Documentation
-------------
The only sources of documentation are this file, along with the commented
souce code and the provided templates but due to the simplicity of the tool,
it's considered to be enough.
